# High Accuracy GPS Implementation
A repository that hosts information for the High Accuracy GPS Implementation project.

## Project Info
This project is from William Del Barrio's and Peter Richardson's Senior Design Project at Mercer University. We were tasked with...
1. Developing a high-accuracy GPS system
2. Implementing it into a [common use case](README.md#use-case)
3. Documenting the process for open-source use on how to possibly implement it into your project

## Client
Our client is Dr. Anthony Choi from Mercer University.

## Use Case
We implemented the GPS system in an autonmous rover as pictured below. This rover system, ie. many of its hardware components, was adopted from a previous project under Dr. Choi.

  More information on how to set the hardware and electronics can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Mercer-Robotics-Club/High_Accuracy_GPS/blob/main/Hardware/Hardware.md#Rover_Hardware">Hardware</a>.

## Supporting Hardware
For the rover, we utilized a variety of hardware and electronics together in it's current design.
